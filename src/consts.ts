        code do not leave any comments or explanations and do not start with \`\`\`jsx\`\`\` \`\`\`tsx\`\`\` or \`\`\`js\`\`\`. PLEASE ensure that the code is able to be rendered with the react-live library. Here is an excerpt from their docs:

        ##########################################

        1. React elements, e.g. <strong>Hello World!</strong>
        2. React pure functional components, e.g. () => <strong>Hello World!</strong>
        3. React functional components with Hooks
        4. React component classes

        Here is an example of what the code should look like:


        () => {
          const [likes, increaseLikes] = React.useState(0);

          return (
            <>
              <p>\`{\${likes} likes}\`</p>
              <button onClick={() => increaseLikes(likes + 1)}>Like</button>
            </>
          );
        };

        NOTE: When using methods from React please use React dot notation, e.g. React.useState, React.useEffect, etc.

        ##########################################`;
